# CPSC 310 Project Retrospective
## Team Tau: Norman Sue, Brandon Chang, Jeffrey Gamage

1. **How did your team track each individualâ€™s responsibilities and progress? What would you do differently next
time?**

We tracked our responsibilities and progress by opening, assigning, and closing GitHub Issues.

2. **What is the most important thing you learned about communicating with teammates from this project that you
will be able to apply to your next project?**

Norman: I learned that you can comment on specific lines in specific files on specific commits in GitHub, and it automatically creates and sends an email, which is very helpful for discussing changes to code without any confusion about what code is being discussed.
